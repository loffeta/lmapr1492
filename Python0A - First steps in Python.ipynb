    "\n",
    "**Python 3 vs Python 2**<br>\n",
    "Two versions of the language exist: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and the 2.x versions were the prevalent releases until December 2008. At that time, the development team made the decision to release version 3.0, which contained a few relatively small but significant changes that were not backward compatible with the 2.x versions. Both Python 2 and 3 have continued to be maintained and developed, with periodic release updates for both. However, an official End Of Life date of January 1, 2020 has been established for Python 2, after which time it will no longer be maintained. We then strongly recomand you to use Python 3 version!\n",

    "**Python is interpreted**<br>\n",
    "In comparison with many other languages, Python is interpreted and not compiled. While other langages need to be compiled in order to translate the code into machine code, the language of your computerâ€™s processor, Python is passed straight to an interpreter that runs it directly.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes for a quicker development cycle because you just type in your code and run it, without the intermediate compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is Open Source**<br>\n",
    "Then, the whole community can contribute to its development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is easy to learn and use**<br>\n",
    "The number of features in the language itself is modest, requiring relatively little investment of time or effort to produce your first programs. The Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is Object-Oriented**<br>\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that reduces the complexity of systems as is employs heavy re-usability of code. OOP leverages the concept of objects and classes. Objects may contain data (known as attributes, stored as instance or class variables) as well as procedures (defined as methods). Objects are generated from blueprints known as classes, which specify the attributes and methods to be generated at the time of object instantiation. \n"

This means that variables initialized in a certain cell can be accessed from any other cell as long as the former is executed before the latter. Try executing the 2 following cells:"
